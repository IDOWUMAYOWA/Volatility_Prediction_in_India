# Volatility_Prediction_in_India
Overview
- This project combines econometrics, financial modeling, and software development to analyze stock data, predict volatility, and deploy a model for real-time predictions. Through this, I aim to deepen my understanding of time series data and hone my technical skills in data transformation, modeling, and API development.

Key Milestones
- Data Collection

  - Utilize the AlphaVantage stock API to retrieve historical stock data for two companies.
  - Learn how to efficiently make HTTP requests and handle API responses.
- Data Transformation

  - Parse and preprocess the stock data into a suitable format for analysis.
  - Use Python classes to organize, clean, and load the data into a SQL database.
- Volatility Analysis

   - Calculate the volatility of the stock data, a critical metric in financial analysis.
   - Apply a GARCH (Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity) model to predict volatility.
- API Development

   - Build a custom web API and server to serve the volatility predictions from the GARCH model.
   - Gain experience in creating production-ready APIs that integrate with machine learning models.
- Skills and Technologies I'll Use and Develop
    - APIs and HTTP Requests

     - Learn how to interact with web APIs like AlphaVantage and retrieve time series data.
     - Handle rate limits and errors when working with external APIs.
- Data Engineering

   - Transform raw data into a structured format suitable for SQL databases.
   - Use Python to implement object-oriented solutions for efficient data handling.
- Financial Modeling

    - Explore econometric models for volatility prediction, specifically GARCH.
    - Understand the importance of volatility in financial decision-making and risk management.
- Deployment

   - Gain hands-on experience in serving machine learning models via a web API.
   - Understand the workflow of deploying a model for real-world use cases.
- Learning Objectives
   - Strengthen my knowledge of time series data analysis through practical application.
   - Understand and implement volatility models commonly used in financial engineering.
   - Gain familiarity with web APIs, including both consuming and building them.
   - Cement concepts learned in prior projects, particularly around data transformation and modeling.
